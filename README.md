# intellinote-cli

A simple Node.js-based command-line client to the Intellinote REST API.

## Installing

### Via npm

intellinote-cli is deployed as an [npm module](https://npmjs.org/) under the name [`intellinote-cli`](https://npmjs.org/package/intellinote-cli). Hence you can install a pre-packaged version with the command:

```bash
npm install -g intellinote-cli
```

Omit the `-g` part to install the module "locally" (in the current working directory).

Once installed, the command `intellinote` should be available in your `node_modules/.bin` directory.

### For use as a library

You can use intellinote-cli within your Node.js module by adding a line like:

```javascript
"intellinote-cli": "latest"
```

to the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` part of your `package.json` file.

### From source

The source code and documentation for intellinote-cli is available on GitHub at [intellinote/intellinote-cli](https://github.com/intellinote/intellinote-cli).  You can clone the repository via:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:intellinote/intellinote-cli
```

Once the code is obtain, you can run:

```bash
make install bin
```

to install any dependencies and build the executeable script.

Once installed, the command `intellinote` should be available in the `intellinote-cli/bin` directory.

## Using

### help

Invoke `intellinote` with the command line parameter `--help` for a quick usage summary:

```bash
$ ./bin/intellinote --help
USE: intellinote login|logout|(GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE|HEAD <URL> [<BODY>])
```

### "Raw" API calls

intellinote-cli provides a simple way to invoke [Intellinote's REST API](https://api.intellinote.net/) using the following form:

    intellinote <HTTP-VERB> <PATH> [<BODY>]

For example, the following command invokes the REST method `/v2.0/ping` (which returns a timestamp):

```bash
$ ./bin/intellinote GET /v2.0/ping"
{"timestamp":1423504162750}
```

### login

Before you can use intellinote-cli you must authenticate to Intellinote using the `login` command.

intellinote-cli ask you for your username and password and then use the OAuth2 protocol to exchange those credentials for an "access token"

```bash
$ ./bin/intellinote login
Username? jane.doe@example.com
Password? ********
```

intellinote-cli does NOT store your username and password.  It does however store the access token value in a file located at `$HOME/.intellinote`.  In a limited sense, that access token can be used much like a password.  You should keep that file secure.

### logout

Invoking `intellinote logout` will remove all log-in information from the configuration file at `$HOME/.intellinote`.  You will need to log in again to access your Intellinote data.

## How to contribute

Your contributions, [bug reports](https://github.com/intellinote/intellinote-cli/issues) and [pull-requests](https://github.com/intellinote/intellinote-cli/pulls) are greatly appreciated.

We're happy to accept any help you can offer, but the following
guidelines can help streamline the process for everyone.

 * You can report any bugs at
   [github.com/intellinote/intellinote-cli/issues](https://github.com/intellinote/intellinote-cli/issues).

    - We'll be able to address the issue more easily if you can
      provide an demonstration of the problem you are
      encountering. The best format for this demonstration is a
      failing unit test (like those found in
      [./test/](https://github.com/intellinote/intellinote-cli/tree/master/test)), but
      your report is welcome with or without that.

 * Our preferred channel for contributions or changes to the
   source code and documentation is as a Git "patch" or "pull-request".

    - If you've never submitted a pull-request, here's one way to go
      about it:

        1. Fork or clone the repository.
        2. Create a local branch to contain your changes (`git
           checkout -b my-new-branch`).
        3. Make your changes and commit them to your local repository.
        4. Create a pull request [as described here](
           https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

    - If you'd rather use a private (or just non-GitHub) repository,
      you might find
      [these generic instructions on creating a "patch" with Git](https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/)
      helpful.

 * If you are making changes to the code please ensure that the
   [unit test suite](./test) still passes.

 * If you are making changes to the code to address a bug or introduce
   new features, we'd *greatly* appreciate it if you can provide one
   or more [unit tests](./test) that demonstrate the bug or
   exercise the new feature.

**Please Note:** We'd rather have a contribution that doesn't follow
these guidelines than no contribution at all.  If you are confused
or put-off by any of the above, your contribution is still welcome.
Feel free to contribute or comment in whatever channel works for you.
